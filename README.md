## Agenda
 
#### 10.30-11 Arrive (coffee and tea available)
   
#### 11-12 AM Introduction and MD Catapult (Frank von Delft DLS and John Overington MD Catapult)
Frank will outline the InnovateUK Proposal and reintroduce CCP CMC
John Overington will describe the MD Catapult
 
#### 12-12.30 PM SQUONK progress and examples (Anthony Bradley DLS/Oxford and Tim Dudgeon IM)
Anthony and Tim will outline recent developments for SQUONK (https://squonk.it/)
Video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek1ojZiIAG0&feature=youtu.be
Reaction enumeration, docking, molecule standardisation, molecule scoring workflows
 
#### 12.30-1.15 PM lunch
 
#### 1.15-2 PM Proposal for Workshop / Study Weekend (Garrett Morris Oxford and Nathan Brown ICR)
Garrett and Nathan to outline training initiative similar to CCP4 study weekend (20 mins)
Aimed at enlisting and supporting naive users
Reach a broad agreement about how to progress this in CCP-CMC.
Group discussion on workshop / study weekend - what each want to achieve (25 mins)
 
2-3.45 PM Crowdsourced challenge: brainstorm on XChem dataset / issues (whole room):
Format -  proposal/summary by expert and then roundtable discussion
Shared community approach
Infrastructure gaps and scientific gaps 
Funding opportunities 
From this weâ€™d like to establish three things:
What is current best-practice for these tasks?
What are the specific challenges that could be addressed?
How can people be involved - what can people contribute - to resolve these problems?
We will be focussing on three distinct tasks
Hit-triaging from an ensemble of fragment structures (Ian Wall -  GSK) 10 minutes of proposal + 1-2 mins each of thoughts
Follow-up workflow on a given hit (Fredrik Svensson - IOTA / Cambridge) 10 mins proposal + 1-2 mins each of thoughts
Compound acquisition (Tim Dudgeon - IM) 5 minutes proposal + 10 minutes of general thoughts
 
3.45-4.15 PM Wrap-up and future planning
Actions for achieving ambitions
Schedule and purpose of next meeting(s)
November at EBI - Lead by ChEMBL / Elixir?
Every 3-6 months? Split into different interest groups? (e.g. Comp-chem / cheminformatics)
 
4.30 PM Close
